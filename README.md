# FaceDetecationWithMobileVisionAPI

Face Detection
Face Detection is a leap forward from the previous Android FaceDetector.Face API. 
It's designed to better detect human faces in images and video for easier editing.
It's smart enough to detect faces even at different orientations -- so if your subject's head is turned sideways, it can detect it.
Specific landmarks can also be detected on faces, such as the eyes, the nose, and the edges of the lips.
